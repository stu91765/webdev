    The targets/ key audience of the software service will be for the older demograph with the hope of stimulating their intellectual thinking via links to websites, apps with brain training games and physical activities via zoom or other channels for all. <span> <P class="box6">(Poli et al., 2013),stated the three areas of concern when introducing technology to stroke patients maybe -</span> </P>
</P>

     

 

<ul>(1) The modality in which the subject performs: brain stimuli and motor gain seem to be greater with intense, active, assistive, and repetitive movements than with nonassistive or passive movements. </ul>

<ul>(2) The graduation of amount and typology of feedback (visual, auditory [43], haptic feedback) in relation to the degree of active subject movements, or to the degree of patient’s attention or active participation: there is still a lack of knowledge on the actual relation between sensory information and patient engagement and effort. This relation should be further investigated to implement the novel robotic systems for rehabilitation, also integrating concepts of the virtual reality.</ul>

<ul>(3) The multilinearity of the exercises that seems to induce more motor cortex excitation.</ul>

<p class="box7">In conclusion to all research, it is obtained that the most efficient way in which to rehabilitate a stroke patient is to both work on physical and mental state of mind. Within the programme software itself will allow the patient to rebuild confidence, dignity, integrity and assist the patient to rehabilitate at their own pace or leisure, contributing to the patient's integrity as an individual. </p>
 
<P>
</span><span class="Cancer"><h2> Cancer patients </h2> </span></p>
<P class="box9">
According to research the most efficient forms of rehabilitation in cancer patients after care are Exercise, eat a balanced diet, maintain a healthy weight, get good sleep, reduce stress, avoid tobacco and limit the amount of alcohol you drink. <span></span>
</P>
<P>
</span><span class="cancer"><h2> heart disease patients </h2> </span></p>

    in America according to some facts heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
<span>

    About 697,000 people in the United States died from heart disease in 2020—thats 1 in every 5 deaths are heart disease related
    
    Heart disease cost the United States about $229 billion each year from 2017 to 2018.3 This includes the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death.
</p>

<p class="box9 ">

    The above pictures were used within the competitor analysis, please find the links Above
    The analysis was primarily based on the following topics,
    <p> however usability and accessibility such as navigation, colour, ux images and readability have been considered.
    </p>


<ul>Engagement of website </ul>
<p><span> NHS site thought the site is informative the site is not engaging. It does provide a video which adds to the user experience UX </span></p>
<p><span>British heart foundation site thought the site is informative the site is not engaging. the site provided a video which adds to the user experience UX the lay out and feel of the web site feels more engaging than the NHS. The site does not have a navigation bar which makes the website less engaging</span></p>
<p><span> Stroke association, the site is informative but not engaging and does not give any videos</span></p>
<ul>Design layout </ul>

<p>
    NHS site thought the site is easy to read however the colour scheme is outdated. The site provides a nav bar but has a poor user experience UX
</p>

<p>
    British heart foundation site has good typology, good colours and a well-spaced layout for the Information provided the website lay out is crisp and smooth in the display.

</p>

<p>
    Stroke association, the site is easy to read however the colour scheme is outdated. The site provides a nav bar but has a poor user experience Ux
</p>

<ul>features and functionality  </ul>
<p>
    NHS site features and functionality the site is too simple and has an outdated design, the site provides a simple navigation system but is not very user friendly and is not very engaging, the site provides healthy links but is not responsive and does not provide community hub or any form of interaction or feedback form.

</p>
               <p>
                British heart foundation site overall has the best UX out of the three competitors and is the most readable the site provides adequate navigation system and is very informative. The site provides a video at the top of the page which is very engaging to the user. the site provides healthy links but is not responsive and does not provide community hub or any form of interaction or feedback form. The site provides the best accessibility for users who may have visual impairments or designed for the older demography

               </p>
               <p>
 
                Stroke association, the sites colour scheme maybe too much of a contrast for the older demography to read. The search tool/bar allows the user to navigate the pages smoothly, the page was the quickest to load (fastest load time) which also enhances user experience. The typology is hard to read, however. the site provides healthy links but is not responsive and does not provide community hub or any form of interaction or feedback form
